I am always up to new challenges and responsibilities. I'm currently a freelancer, but I'm looking for opportunities to work in my field at a company.",
      "second": "With a degree in Computer Science, I have been developing for over 3 years. In this time I worked with many different technologies from C to Java and even with Go. However, Python has always been my favorite language because of its simplicity and readability. It allows me to focus on the problem at hand rather than getting lost in the syntax details like other languages ​​can sometimes do.",
